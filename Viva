Practical 1 – Data Manipulation using dplyr
Q: What is dplyr?
A: dplyr is an R package used for data manipulation such as filtering, selecting, arranging,
and summarizing data.
Q: What does filter() do?
A: filter() is used to select rows based on a condition.
Q: What is select()?
A: select() is used to select specific columns from a dataset.
Q: What does mutate() do?
A: mutate() creates a new column or modifies an existing column.
Q: What is summarize()?
A: summarize() calculates summary statistics like mean, median, etc.
Q: What is group_by()?
A: group_by() groups data based on a column for analysis.


Practical 2 – Data Manipulation using mtcars dataset
Q: What is mtcars dataset?
A: mtcars is a built-in dataset in R that contains car information.
Q: What does arrange() do?
A: arrange() sorts the dataset in ascending or descending order.
Q: What is pipe operator (%>%)?
A: It passes output of one function as input to another.
Q: Why mutate() is used?
A: To create a new column.


Practical 3 – Grouping and Summarizing Data
Q: Why use group_by()?
A: To divide data into groups for analysis.
Q: What does mean() function do?
A: It calculates the average value.
Q: What is data summarization?
A: It means calculating summary statistics like mean, median, etc.
Q: Why arrange(desc()) is used?
A: To sort data in descending order.


Practical 4 – Outlier Detection
Q: What is an outlier?
A: An outlier is a value that is very different from other values.
Q: What is IQR?
A: IQR (Interquartile Range) = Q3 − Q1.
Q: How to detect outliers?
A: Using lower bound = Q1 − 1.5×IQR and upper bound = Q3 + 1.5×IQR.
Q: What are missing values?
A: Missing values are values not present in dataset (NA).
Q: How to handle missing values?
A: Replace with mean, median, or remove them.


Practical 5 – Bar Plot and Histogram
Q: What is ggplot2?
A: ggplot2 is a package used for data visualization.
Q: What is bar plot?
A: It shows comparison between categories.
Q: What is histogram?
A: Histogram shows distribution of continuous data.
Q: What is geom_bar()?
A: Used to create bar chart.
Q: What is geom_histogram()?
A: Used to create histogram.


Practical 6 – Scatter and Line Plot
Q: What is scatter plot?
A: It shows relationship between two variables.
Q: What is line plot?
A: It shows trend over time.
Q: What is density plot?
A: It shows distribution of data.
Q: What is contour plot?
A: It shows 3D data in 2D form.


Practical 7 – Scatter Plot using ggplot2
Q: Why scatter plot is used?
A: To show relationship between two variables.
Q: What does geom_point() do?
A: It creates scatter plot points.
Q: What is data visualization?
A: It is graphical representation of data.


Practical 8 – Five Number Summary
Q: What is five number summary?
A: Minimum, Q1, Median, Q3, Maximum.
Q: What is median?
A: Middle value of dataset.
Q: What is quantile()?
A: It calculates quartiles.


Practical 9 – Multiple Plots
Q: What is boxplot?
A: It shows distribution and outliers.
Q: Why use multiple histograms?
A: To compare groups.
Q: What is geom_boxplot()?
A: Used to create boxplot.
Q: Why use color and shape?
A: To differentiate groups.


Practical 10 – Visualization using lattice
Q: What is lattice package?
A: It is used for advanced plotting in R.
Q: What is histogram()?
A: Used to show frequency distribution.
Q: What is bwplot()?
A: Used to create boxplot.
Q: What is xyplot()?
A: Used to create scatter plot.
