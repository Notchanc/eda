Aim= lattice system in R environment and graphical window in R and its uses

code


# Load the lattice library
library(lattice)

# Sample data
data <- data.frame(
  group = factor(rep(c("A", "B", "C"), each = 10)),
  x = rnorm(30, mean = c(10, 20, 30), sd = 5)
)

# Create a lattice histogram
histogram(~ x | group, data = data,
    xlab = "value", ylab = "Frequency",
    main = "Histograms by Group")

# Create a lattice boxplot
bwplot(~ x | group, data = data,
    xlab = "Group", ylab = "Value",
    main = "Boxplots by Group")

# Create a lattice scatter plot (with a dummy y variable for demonstration)
xylot(rnorm(30) ~ x | group, data = data,
    xlab = "Variable x", ylab = "Variable y",
    main = "Scatter Plots by Group")
