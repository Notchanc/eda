Aim= lattice system in R environment and graphical window in R and its uses

code


# Load the lattice library
library(lattice)

# Sample data
data <- data.frame(
  group = factor(rep(c("A", "B", "C"), each = 10)),
  x = rnorm(30, mean = c(10, 20, 30), sd = 5)
)

# Create a lattice histogram
histogram(
  ~ x | group,
  data = data,
  xlab = "Value",
  ylab = "Frequency",
  main = "Histograms by Group"
)

# Create a lattice boxplot

# Create a lattice scatter plot
